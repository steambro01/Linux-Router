### ChatGPT definition of the different adapter types

ðŸ”¹ 1. NAT (Network Address Translation)

VM gets internet access through the host machine.
VM is isolated from the host and other VMs (unless port forwarding is configured).
Use when you just need the VM to access the internet (like downloading packages).

ðŸ”¹ 2. NAT Network

Similar to NAT, but multiple VMs can be connected to the same NAT network.
VMs can talk to each other and access the internet.
Requires you to create/configure a NAT Network in VirtualBox.
Use for simulating small LANs that still need internet.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Bridged Adapter

VM connects directly to the same network as your host (via your physical NIC).
VM gets an IP from the same DHCP server as the host (like your home router).
VM is visible on the LAN just like another physical device.
Use when you want your VM to appear as a real device on your network (e.g., SSH from another computer, hosting services).

ðŸ”¹ 4. Host-Only Adapter

Creates a private network between host and VMs.
VMs can talk to each other and the host, but no internet access unless you add another adapter for NAT/Bridged.
Useful for lab environments and testing.
Great for router/firewall projects where you want an isolated LAN.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Internal Network

Like Host-Only, but host cannot access it.
Only VMs on the same internal network can communicate.
No internet access unless routed through another VM with NAT/Bridged.
Good for multi-VM lab simulations where the host shouldnâ€™t interfere.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Generic Driver

Advanced option for special setups (e.g., UDP Tunnel, VDE on Linux).
Rarely needed for normal labs.
