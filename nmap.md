# Nmap

## This file will track my progress testing the vulnerability of my router using nmap

### This screenshot shows an nmap scan ran on a kali linux vm to find all of the connected IP devices on it's network

 The only assigned IP's are the default gateway and the kali vm itself, which the nmap scan shows. Sometimes the scan will return the MAC address or the name of the device.
